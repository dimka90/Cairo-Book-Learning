Basic Exercises
Create and Populate an Array

Create an empty array of felt252.
Append the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 to the array.
Print the second and last elements in the array.
Sum of Elements

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all its elements.
Test it with the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Find the Maximum Value

Implement a function that takes an array of integers and returns the maximum value.
Example: Input [3, 10, 2, 8, 5] should return 10.
Reverse an Array

Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with its elements in reverse order.
Example: Input [1, 2, 3] should return [3, 2, 1].
Intermediate Exercises
Filter Odd Numbers

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns a new array containing only the odd numbers.
Example: Input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] should return [1, 3, 5].
Merge Two Arrays

Write a function that takes two arrays and returns a new array containing all elements from both, preserving the order.
Example: Input [1, 2] and [3, 4] should return [1, 2, 3, 4].
Find Index of an Element

Write a function that takes an array and a target value and returns the index of the target value if it exists, or -1 otherwise.
Example: Input [10, 20, 30] and target 20 should return 1.
Insert at Index

Write a function to insert a value into an array at a specific index.
Example: Input [1, 2, 4], value 3, and index 2 should return [1, 2, 3, 4].
Advanced Exercises
Use Arrays with Structs

Define a struct called Student with fields name (felt252) and score (u32).
